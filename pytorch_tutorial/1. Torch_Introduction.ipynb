    "| Module | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`torch`** | The core module providing multidimensional arrays (tensors) and mathematical operations on them. |\n",
    "| **`torch.autograd`** | Automatic differentiation engine that records operations on tensors to compute gradients for optimization. |\n",
    "| **`torch.nn`** | Provides a neural networks library, including layers, activations, loss functions, and utilities to build deep learning models. |\n",
    "| **`torch.optim`** | Contains optimization algorithms (optimizers) like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop used for training neural networks. |\n",
    "| **`torch.utils.data`** | Utilities for data handling, including the Dataset and DataLoader classes for managing and loading datasets efficiently. |\n",
    "| **`torch.jit`** | Supports Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and TorchScript for optimizing models and enabling deployment without Python dependencies. |\n",
    "| **`torch.distributed`** | Tools for distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines, facilitating parallel computation. |\n",
    "| **`torch.cuda`** | Interfaces with NVIDIA CUDA to enable GPU acceleration for tensor computations and model training. |\n",
    "| **`torch.backends`** | Contains settings and allows control over backend libraries like cuDNN, MKL, and others for performance tuning. |\n",
    "| **`torch.multiprocessing`** | Utilities for parallelism using multiprocessing, similar to Python's multiprocessing module but with support for CUDA tensors. |\n",
    "| **`torch.quantization`** | Tools for model quantization to reduce model size and improve inference speed, especially on edge devices. |\n",
    "| **`torch.onnx`** | Supports exporting PyTorch models to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for interoperability with other frameworks and deployment. |\n",
